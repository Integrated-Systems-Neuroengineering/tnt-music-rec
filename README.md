# Triton NeuroTech Music Recommendation Project
This is an exploratory project under UCSD's Triton NeuroTech student org, aimed at introducing concepts of affect and emotion, as embedded in biosignals and music.
The goal of the project is to make a music recommendation system that is able to infer a listener's mood and suggest music.
